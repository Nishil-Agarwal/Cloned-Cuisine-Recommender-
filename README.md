# Cuisine Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is an undergraduate project developed using concepts of Statistical Machine Learning. The aim is to create a recommendation system for cuisines using the Food.com dataset, which includes recipes and reviews.

## How to Use

1. **Download the Dataset**: Obtain both files from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/irkaal/foodcom-recipes-and-reviews).
2. **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure you have all the necessary Python libraries installed.
3. **Run the Notebooks**: Execute the Python notebooks in the following sequence:
    1. `Preprocessing_Datasets.ipynb`
    2. `data_visualisation.ipynb`
    3. `content_based_filtering.ipynb`
    4. `Collaborative_Filtering.ipynb`
    5. `Accuracy_Collaborative_filtering.ipynb`
    6. `knnclustering.ipynb`
    7. `Neural_Network.ipynb`

## Notebooks Overview

- **Preprocessing Datasets**: This notebook deals with cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis and modeling.
- **Data Visualization**: Explore the dataset visually to gain insights and understand its characteristics.
- **Content-based Filtering**: Implement a recommendation system based on the content of recipes, such as ingredients and cuisine type.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Develop a recommendation system based on user interactions and preferences, leveraging collaborative filtering techniques.
- **Accuracy for Collaborative Filtering**: Measured the accuracy for Collaborative Filtering.
- **KNN Clustering**: Recommend the nearest k recipes and made clusters using them.
- **Neural Network**: Leveraged the power of deep learning to recommend recipes.
